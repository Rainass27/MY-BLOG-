## Introduction

This is a ridiculous piece I am writing in Arvind's class.He is making things difficult for me.

## My first piece of R code

```{r}
#| label: setup
 library(tidyverse)
 library(ggformula)
 library(babynames)
```

```{r}
babynames
```

```{r}
babynames  %>% filter(name== "Raina")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name== "Aditi") %>% 
  gf_line(n ~ year)
```

```         
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Raina" | name == "Rayna")

```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Raina" | name == "Rayna") %>% 
  gf_line(n ~ year, color = ~name)
```

```{r}
#| label: setup

 
```
